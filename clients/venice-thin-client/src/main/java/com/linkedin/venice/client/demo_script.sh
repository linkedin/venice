echo "=== Introduction ==="
echo "This demo showcases two new aggregation features in Venice Thin Client:"
echo "1. countByValue: Count distinct values with TopK optimization"
echo "2. countByBucket: Group records by custom bucket predicates"
echo "Both features run entirely on the client-side for optimal performance."
echo

echo "=== Data Source ==="
echo "We're using an EI test store ($STORE_NAME) populated with employee data"
echo "using the Venice Producer client. The data includes:"
echo "- firstName: Employee first names"
echo "- lastName: Employee last names" 
echo "- age: Employee ages (for bucket analysis)"
echo

echo "=== Step 1: Show Current Data ==="
echo "Let's first look at some sample data:"
echo

echo "emp1:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp1" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp2:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp2" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp3:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp3" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp4:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp4" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp5:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp5" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp6:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp6" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp7:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp7" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp8:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp8" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp9:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp9" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "emp10:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "emp10" false | grep "^value="
echo

echo "=== Step 2: countByValue Demo ==="
echo "countByValue counts distinct values of specified fields"
echo "It includes a TopK feature to limit results to the most common values"
echo

echo "2.1. Count all first names:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "$KEYS" false countByValue firstName 10 | grep "firstName-counts="
echo

echo "2.2. Count top 3 most common first names (TopK feature):"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "$KEYS" false countByValue firstName 3 | grep "firstName-counts="
echo

echo "2.3. Count top 2 most common first names (TopK feature):"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "$KEYS" false countByValue firstName 2 | grep "firstName-counts="
echo

echo "=== Step 3: countByValue with Multiple Fields ==="
echo "countByValue can count multiple fields in one query"
echo

./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "$KEYS" false countByValue "firstName,lastName" 10 | grep -E "(firstName-counts=|lastName-counts=)"
echo

echo "=== Step 4: countByBucket Demo ==="
echo "countByBucket groups records by bucket predicates (e.g., age ranges)"
echo

echo "4.1. Age Bucket Definitions:"
echo "   - 20-25: Young employees (20 <= age < 25)"
echo "   - 26-30: Early career (26 <= age < 30)"
echo "   - 31-35: Mid career (31 <= age < 35)"
echo "   - 36-40: Senior level (36 <= age < 40)"
echo "   - 41-45: Experienced (41 <= age < 45)"
echo

echo "4.2. Executing countByBucket query:"
./query.sh $FABRIC $STORE_NAME "$KEYS" false countByBucket age "20-25,26-30,31-35,36-40,41-45" | grep "age-bucket-counts="
echo

echo "=== Demo Summary ==="
echo "✅ countByValue: Counts distinct values with TopK feature for performance"
echo "✅ countByBucket: Groups records by custom bucket definitions"
echo "✅ Pure client-side aggregation: No server-side compute required"
echo "✅ TopK Feature: Built into countByValue to limit result size"
echo "✅ Multi-field Support: Can aggregate multiple fields simultaneously"
echo

echo "=== Current Project Progress ==="
echo "📋 countByValue: ✅ Implemented and tested"
echo "📋 countByBucket: ✅ Implemented and tested"
echo "📋 Unit Tests: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage"
echo "📋 Integration Tests: ✅ Working with real Venice stores"
echo "📋 Documentation: ✅ API documentation and examples"
echo "📋 Demo Scripts: ✅ Ready for presentation"
echo "📋 Code Review: 🔄 In progress"
echo "📋 Merge Status: ⏳ Pending review approval"

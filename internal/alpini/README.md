"Prospero Alpini (also known as Prosper Alpinus, Prospero Alpinio and Latinized as Prosperus Alpinus) (23 November 1553 
â€“ 6 February 1617) was a Venetian physician and botanist. He travelled around Egypt and served as the fourth prefect in 
charge of the botanical garden of Padua. He wrote several botanical treatises which covered exotic plants of economic 
and medicinal value. His description of coffee and banana plants are considered the oldest in European literature." -

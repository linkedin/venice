These TLA+ specifications today do not have model checking integrated with the gradle build yet (TODO). 
That said, they can be run in a variety of configurations.

Intellij:
     Intellij has a third party plugin which supports running the model checker from IDE: 
     https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17965-tla-
     It is however, fairly new (as of October 2022!), so it's not quite as stable
     potentially.

VSCode:
     VSCode is the newer IDE, and has more first class support from a team within Microsoft: 
     https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alygin.vscode-tlaplus

TLA+Toolbox:
     An eclipse based plugin that is the old standard for running and editing TLA+ code. 
     It has a few more features then VSCode does, but is heavier weight to run.

Command Line (tlaTools.jar)
    https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/ has the list of releases.  Download
    the tlatools.jar file and run it with 
    'java -jar tla2tools.jar TLC -h'
    shows a myriad of configuration options for tuning the model checker.  However,
    you can just jump on in with:
    java -jar tla2tools.jar TLC <filename>
    And it will begine evalauting the model (as well as flag any syntax errors).

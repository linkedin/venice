# Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

Please refer to our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md) for our policy on
responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities.

# Contribution Process

The Venice community welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.

**Contributions of various forms are welcome!**

Please read existing GitHub issues or development work that is in progress or in the backlog to avoid duplication. If you are interested in those existing ones, you can leave a comment in the GitHub issues and the community will try to involve you. If you are not sure if it's duplicated, just create a GitHub issue and ask!

For any PR, a GitHub issue is required.

If you want to contribute something new, and it's not tracked in existing GitHub issues, please create a new GitHub issue and the community will help review the idea. Please state `why` in your GitHub issue. If you already have a short design in mind, you can provide a one pager in the GitHub issue. If the idea in general make sense, then we can proceed to the design or development work. If the change is not small, an [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) should be reviewed and approved by the team.

If you have any feature request, please create a new GitHub issue and the community will collect your feature request and work on it.

If you have any user feedback, please create a new GitHub issue and the community will collect your feedback and work on it.

## For New Contributors

Please follow [Venice Workspace Setup](./dev_guide/workspace_setup.md) and
[Venice Recommended Development Workflow](./dev_guide/recommended_development_workflow.md)

## Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted

1. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it
   fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before
   submitting a pull request. Large features which have never been
   discussed are unlikely to be accepted.

# Contribution Process

The Venice community welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.

**Contributions of various forms are welcome!**

Please read existing GitHub issues or development work that is in progress or in the backlog to avoid duplication. If
you are interested in those existing ones, you can leave a comment in the GitHub issues and the community will try to
involve you. If you are not sure if it's duplicated, just create a GitHub issue and ask!

For any PR, a GitHub issue is required.

If you want to contribute something new, and it's not tracked in existing GitHub issues, please create a new GitHub
issue and the community will help review the idea. Please state `why` in your GitHub issue. If you already have a short
design in mind or change is not small please check the [Venice Improvement Proposal](documentation/design-docs.md)

If you have any feature request, please create a new GitHub issue and the community will collect your feature request
and work on it.

If you have any user feedback, please create a new GitHub issue and the community will collect your feedback and work on
it.

## For New Contributors

Please follow [Venice Workspace Setup](development/workspace-setup.md) and
[Venice Recommended Development Workflow](development/dev-workflow.md)

## Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted

1. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before submitting a pull request. Large features which have never
   been discussed are unlikely to be accepted.

# [Experimental] Online Producer
The Online Producer enables online applications to write data to a Venice store directly. All writes are still
asynchronous, and data is only eventually consistent. However, the APIs guarantee durability of the data if the
operation is successful.

## Prerequisites
To use the Online Producer, the store must meet some prerequisites:
1. It must not have writes disabled
2. It must be a hybrid store
3. It must have a current version.

In addition to the store-level prerequisites, the current version must meet the following prerequisites:
1. It must be configured as hybrid; aka capable of receiving near-line writes
2. It must specify either `ACTIVE_ACTIVE` or `NON_AGGREGATE` data-replication policies
3. It must specify a partitioner that the writer application knows how to use

## API
Detailed Javadocs for the Online Producer API can be accessed [here](https://venicedb.org/javadoc/com/linkedin/venice/producer/VeniceProducer.html).
All of these APIs have at least two versions - one that accepts a logical timestamp and one that doesn't.
1. Logical timestamps (in ms) are what Venice backend will use to resolve conflicts in case multiple writes modify
the same record. An update to Venice could be triggered due to some trigger that can be attributed to a specific
point in time. In such cases, it might be beneficial for applications to mark their updates to Venice with that
timestamp and Venice will persist the record as if it had been received at that point in time - either by applying
the update, dropping the update if a newer update has already been persisted, or applying an update partially only to
fields that have not received an update with a newer timestamp yet.
2. In case the write requests are made without specifying the logical timestamp, then the time at which the message
was produced is used as the logical timestamp during conflict resolution.

## Usage
To create an instance of the producer, `OnlineProducerFactory` should be used since the interface for
`OnlineVeniceProducer` is not yet considered stable and can introduce backward incompatible changes.
```
String storeName = "<store_name>";
ClientConfig clientConfig = ClientConfig.defaultGenericClientConfig(storeName)
    .setVeniceURL("http://router.host:7777")
    ...;
VeniceProperties producerConfig = VeniceProperties.empty();
OnlineVeniceProducer producer = OnlineProducerFactory.createProducer(clientConfig, producerConfig, null);

producer.asyncPut(key, value).get();
producer.asyncDelete(key).get();
producer.asyncUpdate(key, builder -> {
    ((UpdateBuilder) updateBuilderObj)
        .setNewFieldValue(FIELD_NUMBER, 10L);
        .setNewFieldValue(FIELD_COMPANY, "LinkedIn")
        ...;
}).get();
```

## Optional Configs
The online Venice producer can be configured by specifying the following optional configs:

To specify the number of threads dedicated for the online Venice producer. This also controls the number of concurrent
write operations in each producer:
```
client.producer.thread.num = 10
```

To specify the interval at which the client will refresh its schema cache:
```
client.producer.schema.refresh.interval.seconds = 300
```

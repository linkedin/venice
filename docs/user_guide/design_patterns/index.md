# Design Patterns

Venice is a flexible toolkit that can be used in a variety of ways. Although some ways of using Venice may be easier
while others are more sophisticated, the intent is not to be opinionated (although higher level layers on top of Venice
may choose to be opinionated).

This section documents various design patterns that can be implemented by Venice users. The goal is to explain how each
pattern works, what semantics it provides, and ultimately help the architect pick the right tool for the job.

# Documentation Guideline

We prefer simplicity and currently use GitHub page to host Venice documentation. Those documentation will be built automatically by GitHub pipelines in the `main` branch.

## Hierarchy

In order for your docs to be rendered properly in the documentation hierarchy, Venice developers need to add a header
section at the top of each documentation. The `title` section will be what the end user sees in the sidebar, and
the `parent` section represents the parent page of the current page for linking purpose. An example of the header is
below:

```

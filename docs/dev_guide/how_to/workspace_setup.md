# Venice Workspace Setup
We recommend using a Unix-based environment for development, such as Linux or macOS.
If you're on Windows, we recommend using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Fork the Venice Repository
Fork the Venice repo at https://github.com/linkedin/venice

## Setting up the repository locally
```shell
git clone https://github.com/${githubUsername}/venice.git
cd venice
git remote add upstream https://github.com/linkedin/venice.git
git fetch upstream
```

## Setting up Java
We use Java 17 for development. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

## Setting up the IDE
We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for development to take advantage of the debugger, and provide instructions for it.
However, any IDE of your choice should work.

To get the free version of IntelliJ IDEA visit the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), and
download the Community Edition version (not Ultimate). It should be the second download button on the page.

To set up IntelliJ, run:
```shell
./gradlew idea
```

## Setting up your system
### Set the maximum number of open files limit
There are many resources on the web for updating the limits of maximum number of open files for each operating system.
We recommend setting a soft limit of at least `64000` and a hard limit of at least `524288`. Feel free to experiment
with various values and find ones that work for you.

## Build the project
```shell
./gradlew clean assemble
```

## Run the test suite
```shell
./gradlew check --continue
```

## Gradle Cheatsheet
```shell
# Build project classes and artifacts
./gradlew assemble
 
# Run all checks (spotbugs, code coverage, tests etc)
./gradlew check --continue
 
# Run only enabled checks that may fail the build
./gradlew spotbugs
 
# Run all checks, including ones that are in review/incubating stage, and do not fail the build
./gradlew spotbugs -Pspotallbugs -Pspotbugs.ignoreFailures
 
# Run jacoco code coverage check, which will also generate jacoco report
./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification

# Run jacoco code coverage check along with jacoco report and diff coverage check
./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification diffCoverage --continue
 
# Run enabled checks only for main code and in da-vinci-client subproject
./gradlew :clients:da-vinci-client:spotbugsMain

 # Run jacoco code coverage check for a specific module along with jacoco report
./gradlew :clients:da-vinci-client:jacocoTestCoverageVerification

# Run jacoco code coverage check for a specific module along with jacoco report and diff coverage check
./gradlew :clients:da-vinci-client:jacocoTestCoverageVerification diffCoverage

# Run a specific test in any module
$ ./gradlew :sub-module:testType --tests "fully.qualified.name.of.the.test"

# To run a specific integration test
$ ./gradlew :internal:venice-test-common:integrationTest --tests "fully.qualified.name.of.the.test"
```

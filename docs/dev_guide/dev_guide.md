# Developer Guide

This section includes guides for Venice developers.

New contributors should visit the [How to Contribute to Venice](./how_to/how_to.md) subsection to get started.

Those looking for a general overview of the project structure may be interested to look at [Navigating the Project](navigating_project.md).

The rest of this section is to document implementation details.

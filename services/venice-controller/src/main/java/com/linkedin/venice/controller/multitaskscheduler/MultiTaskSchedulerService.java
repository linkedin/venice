/**
 *  This service functions as an interface for scheduling various kind of tasks by loading multiple different task managers.
 *  Each task manager is assigned a java executor to enable scheduling and executing tasks in parallel.
 *
 *  The life cycle of this service matches the life cycle of {@link HelixVeniceClusterResources}, which means there is one
 *  multitask scheduler service per cluster. The multitask scheduler service is built when the controller is promoted
 *  to leader role for the cluster.
 *
 *  Currently, store migration manager is initialized and loaded inside within this service, it is responsible for managing
 *  the store migration process, and it is the only task manager currently loaded into this service. For each service per
 *  cluster, the store migration task is scheduled inside task scheduler service of the source cluster

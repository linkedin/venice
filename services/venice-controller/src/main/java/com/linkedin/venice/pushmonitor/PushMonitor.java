/**
 * In Venice, Push is a task that asynchronously writes data to Venice. Currently, Venice supports 2 kinds of push schemes --
 * pushing from Hadoop(offline) and pushing from Samza(nearline).
 *
 * Push Monitor is a critical component in Venice controller that keeps track of ongoing and finished pushes
 * in the cluster.
 *
 * Inheritors are expected to be able to:
 * 1. persist recent push history even after restart. This is the first-hand information for debugging push failures
 * 2. Tell what a push's current status is.
 * 3. Switch store's versions when pushes are finished and new data is ready to serve traffic.

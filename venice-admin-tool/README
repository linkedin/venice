 -h,--help                      Show usage
 -k,--key-schema-file <arg>     Path to text file with key schema
 -l,--value-schema-file <arg>   Path to text file with value schema
 -n,--new <arg>                 OPTIONAL: Create one of: store
 -o,--owner <arg>               Owner email for new store creation
 -q,--query <arg>               OPTIONAL: Query one of: next, available,
                                current, job, list, describe
 -r,--router <arg>              REQUIRED: Venice router url, eg.

 -s,--store <arg>               Name of Venice store
 -v,--version <arg>             Venice store version number

Examples:
--query list (no other arguments required)
--query describe (optionally takes --store to only describe one store.  Otherwise describes all stores)
--query next, --query available, --query current (Requires --store)
--query job (Requires --store, --version)
--new store (Requires --store, --owner, --key-schema-file, --value-schema-file)

## Overview of Queries

Note:  All queries require a router (of form `http://<host>:<port>`) and a cluster.

### NEXT

Requires: store

Next available (unreserved) version number.  Returns an integer.

### AVAILABLE

Requires: store

All version numbers that the storage nodes can serve.  These are the only versions that we can set as current (for example for a rollback).  Returns a list of integers, eg: [3, 4]

### CURRENT

Requires: store

The version that is currently being served by the router.  Returns an integer.

### JOB

Requires: store, version

Job status for storage node consumption.

### LIST

Displays (newline delimited) all stores in the cluster

### DESCRIBE

Displays all version information about all stores in the cluster.  If a store is specified, then it only shows details for that store.

```
Store: myCountry2	Available versions: [1]	Current version: 1	Next version: 2
Store: myCountry	Available versions: [2, 3, 4]	Current version: 4	Next version: 6
```

## Overview of New

### STORE

Requires: store, owner, key-schema-file, value-schema-file

Creates a new store.

## Future commands to add:

 * Set version
 * Delete version
 * Delete store?
 * ???

 * Put clusters and routers into a passed-in config file to query multiple clusters at once

## Overview of Queries

Note:  All queries require a router (of form `http://<host>:<port>`) and a cluster.

### NEXT

Requires: store

Next available (unreserved) version number.  Returns an integer.

### AVAILABLE

Requires: store

All version numbers that the storage nodes can serve.  These are the only versions that we can set as current (for example for a rollback).  Returns a list of integers, eg: [3, 4]

### CURRENT

Requires: store

The version that is currently being served by the router.  Returns an integer.

### JOB

Requires: store, version

Job status for storage node consumption.

### LIST

Displays (newline delimited) all stores in the cluster

### DESCRIBE

Displays all version information about all stores in the cluster.  If a store is specified, then it only shows details for that store.

```
Store: myCountry2	Available versions: [1]	Current version: 1	Next version: 2
Store: myCountry	Available versions: [2, 3, 4]	Current version: 4	Next version: 6
```

### Future commands to add:

 * Set version
 * Delete version
 * Delete store?
 * ???

 * Put clusters and routers into a passed-in config file to query multiple clusters at once
